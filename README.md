# Stockataka - Sulu Full Stack-athon Project

Welcome to **Stockataka**, an EduTech solution blending education and entertainment, created as part of the **Sulu Full Stack-athon**! This platform uses the **Pokemon API** and **Technical Analysis API** to simplify financial education. By mapping Pokemon to company stocks based on attack stats and matching industries with relevant Pokemon types, Stockataka makes learning about finance fun, engaging, and memorable. Thanks to the **Sulu** and **DUCSS** for providing the opportunity to innovate!

## Inspiration

Finance and stock markets can be complex and intimidating. With Stockataka, we aim to demystify financial concepts by harnessing the universal appeal of Pokemon. Our platform brings financial analysis to life by making stocks accessible and exciting through the Pokemon universe, helping students engage with market trends in a fun and relatable way.

## Features

### 1. Choose Your Pokemon (and Company)
   - Users select a Pokemon based on attack stats, which correspond to the stock price of a specific company. Higher attack stats are mapped to higher-priced stocks.
   - Sectors like technology, energy, and healthcare are matched with Pokemon types that share thematic similarities (e.g., electric types for tech companies).

### 2. Simplified Technical Analysis for Students
   - Stockataka displays technical indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, and more, using Pokemon-themed explanations.
   - This approach helps students build a foundation in financial analysis without getting overwhelmed by jargon.

## How It Works

1. **Backend APIs Integration**:
   - **Pokemon API**: Fetches data about each Pokemonâ€™s stats and types.
   - **Technical Analysis API**: Supplies stock market data for companies in corresponding sectors.

2. **Mapping Logic**:
   - **Pokemon Attack Stats to Stock Prices**: Pokemon with higher attack stats represent higher-priced stocks.
   - **Sectors to Types**: Sectors like energy, healthcare, and finance are mapped to thematically related Pokemon types (e.g., water types for energy stocks).

3. **Data Processing and Transformation**:
   - Stockataka translates complex stock data into Pokemon-style descriptions, making the learning process both interactive and informative.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
